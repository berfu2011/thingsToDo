# thingsToDo
It's a really small JavaScript project that i made to demonstrate my javascript interest and practises . It adds ,deletes duties on front end and also on  localstorage. It includes main.css, ToDoList.js and ToDoList.html files.
AddDuty function adds duties to the list (ul) also to local storage
dutyDoneDelete function decrease the opasity of dutyitem when we click check icon . and deletes the duty from the list and local storage when we click trash  icon
addToLocalStorage adds the duties to local storage we also call it in addduty function 
The longest function is createDutyItem. When we add a duty it creates all HTML elements belongs to duty item.
readLocalStorage reads all datas(duties) on the local storage and shows them when upload the website initially.
DeleteItemFromLocal as it's name deletes the the duties from the page and localstorage
